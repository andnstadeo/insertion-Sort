# insertion-Sort

Big O Complexity
Time Complexity:
 -> Worst-case: O(n^2) - When the list is in reverse order, the inner loop runs for almost every element, leading to a quadratic time complexity.
 -> Average-case: O(n^2) - The average time complexity is also quadratic, as it involves nested loops.
 -> Best-case: O(n) - When the list is already sorted, the inner loop doesn't run, resulting in a linear time complexity.

Space Complexity:
 -> O(1) - Insertion sort is an in-place algorithm, meaning it doesn't require additional memory for sorting, making it space-efficient.
